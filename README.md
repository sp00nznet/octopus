# octopus

Octopus is a tool to migrate vms from a vcenter cluster to other sources. It should be able to move to another vcenter instance. It will be a server and a client. these will both be containerized. the client will be html5 and web accessible. it will use ad auth. There will be persistant storage to track activities, log migrations etc. The goal is to take a vm from vmware and push it to vmware or aws or gcp or azure. this tool should be able to do all of these activities. The Tool is intended as a disaster recover tool and as such will need to come up with creative solutions to keep the vms in sync until the cut over. Cut over/failovers will be scheduled through the web interface. the web interface will have an admin portal for storing env varialb.es a vm must come across with the same hardware, the same mac, the same distributed port groups. We want size estimation. VX rail vs plain esxi report different sizes. be able to know how much a vm will shrink or grow depending on the enviornment its in.
